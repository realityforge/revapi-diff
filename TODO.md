# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Change package process to use shading. This is mostly so that the service files are
  correctly merged. Otherwise merge the files in META-INF as required.

* Add an automated release process.
