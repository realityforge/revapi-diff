# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Consider removing several of the fields in attachments that we are unlikely to ever use
  such as `exampleUseChainInNewApi`, `oldArchive`, `oldArchive` etc. Also could remove
  fields that are duplicate information such as `name` and `description` (derivable from
  `code`) and possibly `newElement`,`oldElement`,`newElementModule`,`oldElementModule` if
  they are null.
